If you want to download and install BootCamp 6.0.6133 on your Mac OS X, you have two options:
 
1. Use the Boot Camp Assistant application that comes with your Mac. This is the official and recommended way to get BootCamp drivers and software. To do this, follow these steps:
    - Open the Boot Camp Assistant application from the Utilities folder or Spotlight.
    - Select "Action" on the Menu Bar and choose "Download Windows Support Software".
    - Choose a location to save the downloaded files. You will need a USB flash drive or an external hard drive with at least 16 GB of free space.
    - When the download is complete, insert your Windows installation media (DVD or USB) and follow the instructions to create a Windows partition and install Windows on your Mac.
    - After Windows is installed, plug in the USB flash drive or external hard drive that contains the BootCamp files and run the setup.exe file to install the drivers and software.
    - Restart your Mac and enjoy Windows 10 on your Mac.
2. Use a third-party tool called Brigadier (https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier) that can download BootCamp drivers from Apple's servers based on your Mac model number. This is an unofficial and alternative way to get BootCamp drivers and software. To do this, follow these steps:
    - Download Brigadier from https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier/releases and unzip it.
    - Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder where you extracted Brigadier.
    - Type "python brigadier.py --model <your mac="" model="" number="">" without quotes and press Enter. You can find your Mac model number from How to identify MacBook Pro models - Apple Support[^2^]. For example, if you have a late 2013 15-inch MacBook Pro, type "python brigadier.py --model MacBookPro11,2".</your>
    - Wait for Brigadier to download the BootCamp files for your Mac model. It will create a folder named "BootCamp-xxx-xxxxx" where xxx-xxxxx is your Mac model identifier.
    - Copy the folder to a USB flash drive or an external hard drive with at least 16 GB of free space.
    - Follow the same steps as above to create a Windows partition and install Windows on your Mac using your Windows installation media.
    - After Windows is installed, plug in the USB flash drive or external hard drive that contains the BootCamp folder and run the setup.exe file to install the drivers and software.
    - Restart your Mac and enjoy Windows 10 on your Mac.
